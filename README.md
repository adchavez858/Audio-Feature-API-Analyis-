# Final-Project
Module 20: Final Project


10/10 recap:

K-means clustering with spotify audio featuring such as acousticness, danceability, energy, loudness, etc..

mapping by genre/by city with layers
limit data to a small amount of genres and start off with just the top(10?) cities

using location info through songkick



Questions to ask:

What genres are the most popular in each of the top touring cities?
  - What audio features can help predict the success of a genre on tour?

My assignment for this week:
establish dataset of 1000 songs of random genres

----------

10/11 recap:

discussed cleaning up dataset with ETL (narrowing down genres, tidying up names, drop duplicate songs
back up plan for no song kick api is to focus on music over time instead of music by location

Possible back up questions:
How has the popularity of genres changed over time?
  - are the audio features similar?

Team assignment: clean up data and dabble with machine learning


-----------

10/12 recap
further discussed Klearning models


My assignment: start matplotlib plots
