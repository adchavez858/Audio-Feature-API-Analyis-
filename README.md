Module 20: Final Project

10/10 recap:

K-means clustering with spotify audio featuring such as acousticness, danceability, energy, loudness, etc..

mapping by genre/by city with layers
limit data to a small amount of genres and start off with just the top(10?) cities

using location info through songkick



Questions to ask:

What genres are the most popular in each of the top touring cities?
  - What audio features can help predict the success of a genre on tour?
