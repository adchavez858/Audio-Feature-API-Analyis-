## Overview 

Culturally, the United States is a complex tapestry comprised of a multitude of influences and backgrounds. This is reflected in particular by the varying musical genres present across the nation, and in some cases around the world. With such a wide influence, many individuals and groups try to break into this industry with dreams of reaching the top of the charts and connecting with millions of people. Unfortunately, this task is much more difficult than many anticipate so only a handfull of people ever reach this goal. Many speculate that the success of these few artist can be traced back to connections, and a stroke of luck. Although this may be true in some instances, the goal of this analysis is to determine if there are any audio features that can help predict the success of an artist and their music in American popculture.
